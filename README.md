# library-bot (name tbc)
`v0.1` A bot that tweets information about PC availability in the Library at the University of Glasgow
The information is normally only accessible from the university's network [here](https://www.gla.ac.uk/sapp/PC/index.html).
I thought that was a bit of a waste of time.     
This program works by running crontab jobs on both my laptop (soon Heroku) and the university server.
