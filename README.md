# UofG Library bot (name suggestions appreciated)
`v1.0` A bot that tweets information about PC availability in the Library at the University of Glasgow
The information is normally only accessible from the university's network [here](https://www.gla.ac.uk/sapp/PC/index.html).
I thought that was a bit of a waste of time.     
This program works by regularly pulling data from the Library's stats API, parsing it, and tweeting it.

Always a work in progress
